        I was born and raised in Olympia, Washington, with my mom, dad, and two younger brothers.
        From a young age, I've found joy in solving puzzles, and this has led me to explore the
        field of Computer Science. It's my dream to have a positive influence across the globe, and
        I believe software is the appropriate medium for me to accomplish this. I've become
        enamored with the seemingly endless applications of machine learning and have thus chosen
        machine learning as my area of specialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of computer science, I enjoy spending time with friends, rock climbing, and playing
        spikeball. I also love to travel, explore, and learn new skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. I am
        graduating in Spring 2020, so I am looking for full time opportunities!

          This was the beginning of my hackathon career.
          The idea for a robotic ramen machine actually came about before I entered college.
          Over the summer, I was direct messaging my future roommate, and we were fantasizing
          how great an automatic ramen machine would be. Ramen is the quintessential college
          meal, and since we all know we're too busy studying, a ramen robot seems necessary
          for a college student's life. A few weeks into college, we heard about CMU's
          beginner hackathon HackCMU. This would be the perfect opportunity to build this!
          We bought wood, scrapped together cardboard and duct tape, and found an arduino, and
          the rest is history. We successfully created an internet of things robotic ramen
          preparer controlled by an iPhone app. Bob's Ramen won the Mentor's Choice Award
          sponsored by Microsoft.

          When you're at a hackathon with 3 other ECE (electrical and computer engineering)
          majors you shouldn't be surprised if your project is about resistors. Our idea was
          to design 3D printed parts representing circuit components (source, ground, resistor),
          and then make an app that would visualize the circuit flow through a given circuit
          configuration. None of us had experience with augmented reality, but we decided to
          go for the challenge. The project would also have educational applications. We
          happened upon the Vuforia SDK which could be coupled with Unity to make augmented
          reality apps using QR codes as targets. I primarily worked on the algorithms which
          outputted the electron flow direction and locations as well as the solved resistor
          potential differences and electric current. We made ResistAR at TartanHacks, Carnegie
          Mellon's premiere hackathon and won the grand prize.

          Inventex is an internet-enabled hardware sorter and inventory maintenance machine.
          It works with a mobile app built in React Native. I was in charge of making the
          mobile app and configuring the raspberry pi to take incoming commands. The problem
          it was aimed towards was messy workspaces. With Inventex, you can scan the piece of
          hardware that you want to desposit with the app, then put it in the machine's input
          slot. The machine then allocates a bin for that category of hardware and deposits
          the hardware in it. When you want to retrieve something, you can select the
          hardware type and amount from the app interface and the machine will spit it out for
          you. We made Inventex at PennApps, and we won the best hardware hack award.

          At the Facebook Global Hackathon, my team and I created something called Facebook
          Discourse. A bit of background about the Facebook Global Hackathon: every year
          Facebook invites the winners of a handful of hackathons from across the globe.
          When I participated, there were 20 teams from 11 different countries. I qualified
          because my team won the grand prize at TartanHacks. Some other hackathons from the
          US that are represented are PennApps, HackMIT, and TreeHacks (Stanford). Facebook
          Discourse is a debate platform that fosters positive discourse by only allowing
          positive interactions from spectators like up-voting debate points and also adding
          credible sources. Additionally, users can follow debate threads that are
          automatically detected by the system. This could be used with presidential debates
          by visualizing the arguments on our platform. We presented Facebook Discourse to
          the VPs of technology of OculusVR, WhatsApp, and Instagram and won first prize.

          At PennApps, my team and I made Modware, a modular hardware prototyping kit for the
          software engineer to take the "hard" out of hardware. Modware is a magnetic board
          with magnetically attachable hardware components such as light switches, knobs, and
          lights. The idea is that with Modware, the user would be able to easily hook up
          hardware components to anything they might need without having to know the details
          of electrical engineering. Modware also includes a UI to connect
          the components to each other and configure APIs with the hardware components.
          One of the examples we set up was using a knob to control the depth of a Sierpinski's
          triangle rendering. A software engineer could also make a light flash to alert
          them of something like a stock hitting a certain price. I personally worked on the
          backend design including data structures and data passing and also the examples of
          how Modware can be used by a software engineer. Modware earned us four awards: the
          PennApps 2nd place prize, Lutron's IOT award, Best Hardware Hack, and Hacker's
          favorite award.

          The Simon System consists of Simon, our robot that learns to perform the human's input
          actions. There are two "play" fields, one for the human to perform actions and the other
          for Simon to reproduce actions. Everything starts with a human action. The Simon System
          detects human motion and records what happens. Then those actions are interpreted into
          actions that Simon can take. Then Simon performs those actions in the second play field,
          making sure to plan efficient paths taking into consideration that it is a robot in the
          field. I implemented the computer vision, path planning, robot feedback control, and
          communication between components of the project. The computer vision systems intelligently
          detects when updates are made to the human control field and acquires normalized grid
          size of the play field using QR boundaries. The robot's orientation is also corrected
          using information from the computer vision. The path planning system uses a modified
          BFS algorithm taking into account path smoothing with realtime updates from the
          low-level controls to calibrate path plan throughout execution. Communication
          throughout the project uses bluetooth and unix sockets.

              At Cruise Automation, I am investigating and adapting deep learning compiler technologies
              for machine learning inference on the vehicle. This involves getting familiar
              with Cruise's perception models, learning the details of the technology
              I am dealing with, making use of profiling tools to gain more insight
              into inference performance, and adding features for Cruise's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also
              working on the Cruise deep learning inference framework to unify and streamline
              the deployment of models onto the autonomous vehicle.

              Over the summer I had the incredible opportunity to intern at this world-class self
              driving car company. While there, I built the core communication system between the
              self driving cars and the fleet monitoring dashboard. I worked with Qt, nginx,
              Flask, React, and Redux. My software was promptly adopted into the Vehicle
              Operations team's daily workflow. (The Vehicle Operations team is in charge of
              carrying out tests on the vehicles).

            <p>
              During my internship, I also added hyperparameter tuning capabilities to the
              perception training script and created a tool to plot in Google Earth the global
              poses of perception training data along with their properties. For these projects
              I used Tensorflow, Python, and C++.

            This is a course about fundamental computing principles for students with minimal
            or no computing background. It teaches programming constructs and also covers
            history and applications of computing. My responsibilities included leading
            recitation, conducting office hours, grading assignments/tests, and discussing
            how to improve the course. I spent around 8-10 hours a week on this.
