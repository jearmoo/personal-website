        I was born and raised in Olympia, Washington, with my mom, dad, and two younger brothers.
        From a young age, I've found joy in solving puzzles, and this has led me to explore the
        field of Computer Science. It's my dream to have a positive influence across the globe, and
        I believe software is the appropriate medium for me to accomplish this. I've become
        enamored with the seemingly endless applications of machine learning and have thus chosen
        machine learning as my area of specialization.
        <br/><br/>
        Outside of computer stuff, I enjoy spending time with friends, climbing rocks, and playing
        spikeball. I am learning to play the ukelele and satiating my curiosity with books and
        articles.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently I'm pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon as a junior.

            This was the beginning of my hackathon career.
            The idea for a robotic ramen machine actually came about before I entered college.
            Over the summer, I was direct messaging my future roommate, and we were fantasizing
            how great an automatic ramen machine would be. Ramen is the quintessential college
            meal, and since we all know we're too busy studying, a ramen robot seems necessary
            for a college student's life. A few weeks into college, we heard about CMU's
            beginner hackathon HackCMU. This would be the perfect opportunity to build this!
            We bought wood, scrapped together cardboard and duct tape, and found an arduino, and
            the rest is history. We successfully created an internet of things robotic ramen
            preparer controlled by an iPhone app. Bob's Ramen won the Mentor's Choice Award
            sponsored by Microsoft.

            When you're at a hackathon with 3 other ECE (electrical and computer engineering)
            majors you shouldn't be surprised if your project is about resistors. Our idea was
            to design 3D printed parts representing circuit components (source, ground, resistor),
            and then make an app that would visualize the circuit flow through a given circuit
            configuration. None of us had experience with augmented reality, but we decided to
            go for the challenge. The project would also have educational applications. We
            happened upon the Vuforia SDK which could be coupled with Unity to make augmented
            reality apps using QR codes as targets. I primarily worked on the algorithms which
            outputted the electron flow direction and locations as well as the solved resistor
            potential differences and electric current. We made ResistAR at TartanHacks, Carnegie
            Mellon's premiere hackathon and won the grand prize.

            Inventex is an internet-enabled hardware sorter and inventory maintenance machine.
            It works with a mobile app built in React Native. I was in charge of making the
            mobile app and configuring the raspberry pi to take incoming commands. The problem
            it was aimed towards was messy workspaces. With Inventex, you can scan the piece of
            hardware that you want to desposit with the app, then put it in the machine's input
            slot. The machine then allocates a bin for that category of hardware and deposits
            the hardware in it. When you want to retrieve something, you can select the
            hardware type and amount from the app interface and the machine will spit it out for
            you. We made Inventex at PennApps, and we won the best hardware hack award.

            At the Facebook Global Hackathon, my team and I created something called Facebook
            Discourse. A bit of background about the Facebook Global Hackathon: every year
            Facebook invites the winners of a handful of hackathons from across the globe.
            When I participated, there were 20 teams from 11 different countries. I qualified
            because my team won the grand prize at TartanHacks. Some other hackathons from the
            US that are represented are PennApps, HackMIT, and TreeHacks (Stanford). Facebook
            Discourse is a debate platform that fosters positive discourse by only allowing
            positive interactions from spectators like up-voting debate points and also adding
            credible sources. Additionally, users can follow debate threads that are
            automatically detected by the system. This could be used with presidential debates
            by visualizing the arguments on our platform. We presented Facebook Discourse to
            the VPs of technology of OculusVR, WhatsApp, and Instagram and won first prize.

            At PennApps, my team and I made Modware, a modular hardware prototyping kit for the
            software engineer to take the "hard" out of hardware. Modware is a magnetic board
            with magnetically attachable hardware components such as light switches, knobs, and
            lights. The idea is that with Modware, the user would be able to easily hook up
            hardware components to anything they might need without having to know the details
            of electrical engineering. Modware also includes a UI to connect
            the components to each other and configure APIs with the hardware components.
            One of the examples we set up was using a knob to control the depth of a Sierpinski's
            triangle rendering. A software engineer could also make a light flash to alert
            them of something like a stock hitting a certain price. I personally worked on the
            backend design including data structures and data passing. Modware earned us four
            awards: the PennApps 2nd place prize, Lutron's IOT award, Best Hardware Hack, and
            Hacker's favorite award.
