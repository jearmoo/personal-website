          I was born and raised in Olympia, Washington with my mom, dad, and two younger brothers.

          field of Computer Science. It's my dream to have positive influence across the globe, and
          I believe software is the appropriate medium for me to accomplish this. I've become
          enamored with the seemingly endless applications of machine learning and have thus chosen
          machine learning as my area of specialization.

              This was the beginning of my hackathon career.
              The idea for a robotic ramen machine actually came about before I came to college.
              Over the summer, I was direct messaging my future roommate, and we were fantasizing
              how great an automatic ramen machine would be. Ramen is the quintessential college 
              meal, and since we all know we're too busy studying, a ramen robot seems necessary
              for a college student's life. A few weeks into college, we heard about CMU's
              beginner's hackathon HackCMU. This would be the perfect opportunity to build this!
              We bought wood, scrapped together cardboard and duct tape, and found an arduino, and
              the rest is history. We successfully created a robotic inernet of things ramen
              preparer controlled by an iPhone app. Bob's Ramen won the Mentor's Choice Award
              sponsored by Microsoft.

              When you're at a hackathon with 3 other ECE (electrical and computer engineering)
              majors you shouldn't be surprised if your project is about resistors. Our idea was
              to design 3D printed parts representing circuit components (source, ground, resistor),
              and then make an app that would visualize the circuit flow through a given circuit
              configuration. None of us had experience with augmented reality, but we decided to
              go for the challenge. The project would also have educational applications. We
              happened upon the Vuforia SDK which could be coupled with Unity to make augmented
              reality apps using QR codes as targets. I primarily worked on the algorithms which
              outputted the electron flow direction and locations as well as the solved resistor
              potential differences and current flow. We made ResistAR at TartanHacks, Carnegie
              Mellon's premiere hackathon and won the grand prize.

              Inventex is an internet-enabled hardware sorter and inventory maintenance machine.
              It works with a mobile app built in React Native. I was in charge of making the 
              mobile app and configuring the raspberry pi to take incoming commands. The problem
              it was aimed towards was messy workspaces. With Inventex, you can scan the piece of
              hardware that you want to desposit with the app, then put it in the machine's input
              slot. The machine then allocates a bin for that category of hardware and deposits
              the hardware in it. When you want to retrieve something, you can select the
              hardware type and amount from the app interface and the machine will spit it out for
              you. We made Inventex at PennApps, and we won the best hardware hack award.

              At the Facebook Global Hackathon, my team and I created something called Facebook
              Discourse. A bit of background about the Facebook Global Hackathon: every year
              Facebook invites the winners of a handful of hackathons from across the globe.
              When I participated, there were 20 teams from 11 different countries. I qualified
              because my team won the grand prize at TartanHacks. Some other hackathons from the
              US that are represented are PennApps, HackMIT, and TreeHacks (Stanford). Facebook
              Discourse is a debate platform that fosters positive discourse by only allowing
              positive interactions from spectators like upvoting points made and also adding
              credible sources. Additionally, users can follow debate threads that are
              automatically detected by the system. This could be used with presidential debates
              by visualizing the arguments on our platform. We presented Facebook Discourse to
              the VPs of technology of OculusVR, WhatsApp, and Instagram and won first prize.

              At PennApps, my team and I made Modware, a Modular Hardware Prototyping kit for the
              Software Engineer to take the "hard" out of hardware. Modware is a magnetic board
              with magnetically attachable hardware components such as light switches, knobs, and
              lights. The idea is that with Modware, the user would be able to easily hook up
              hardware components to anything they might need without having to know the details
              of electrical engineering. Modware also includes a UI to connect
              the components to each other and configure apis with the hardware components.
              One of the examples we set up was using a knob to control the depth of a Sierpinski's
              triangle rendering. A software engineer could also make a light flash to alert
              them of something like a stock hitting a certain price. I personally worked on the
              backend design including data structures and data passing. Modware earned us four
              awards: the PennApps 2nd place prize, Lutron's IOT award, best Hardware Hack, and
              Hacker's favorite award.
